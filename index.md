### Project Ideas

* R
* Python (matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.)
* SQL
* Tableau
* ML Algorithms: Random Forests, Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes for document classification, LDA for topic analysis, Recommendation engine (spark based?), K-means or something more interesting for unsupervised, a streaming online learning algorithm (use spark streaming + KAFKA)
