### Random Forest Use in Predicting Cancer

**Download:** [Presentation](non-images/MAGANA-ZOOK_Random ForestsAndTheirApplicationToCancerPrediction.pdf)     

**Overview:** This presentation introduces viewers to what random forests are, how machine learning has played a historic role in the medical field, and how random forests are becoming the preferred solution for classifying samples as cancerous or benign over black-box techniques like neural networks.
 

## <a name="DataScienceProjects"></a>Data Science Projects

### San Francisco Crime Data Analysis

**Technologies Used:** R

**Project Writeup:** [Report](SfDataAnalysis.html)

**Overview:** Using a dataset from a Kaggle competition, practice of the data science process was conducted in the R language to include: data acquisition, ingestion, preparation, exploratory analysis, and model building.

### Other Project Ideas

* R
* Python (matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.)
* SQL
* Tableau
* ML Algorithms: Random Forests, Logistic Regression, SVM, Naive Bayes for document classification, LDA for topic analysis, Recommendation engine (spark based?), K-means or something more interesting for unsupervised, a streaming online learning algorithm (use spark streaming + KAFKA)

### Blood Pressure Diary

![Screenshot of the main user interface in the Blood Pressure Diary application.](images/BloodPressureAndroidMainScreen.png)

**Technologies Used:** Java (Android SDK), RoboGuice (dependency injection framework)

**Code Repository:** [GitHub](https://github.com/stevenmz/BloodPressureDiary)

**Overview:** This application was written to make it easy for people who need to track their blood pressure to do so from anywhere using their smartphone. Features of this application include: adding blood pressure readings, viewing readings in list or graph form, export of readings for sending to a health provider, and a help section that provides information on blood pressure ranges from a trusted medical source (Mayo Clinic).
